### v1.8 Esquimalt Launch (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Validate the Legistar InSite scraper against Esquimalt, ingest recent meetings through the full pipeline, add hostname-based municipality routing, and deploy Esquimalt at esquimalt.viewroyal.ai with the full feature set.

- [ ] **Phase 41: Data Isolation** - Municipality-scope all service layer queries, search RPCs, and RAG agent to prevent cross-municipality data leakage
- [ ] **Phase 42: Esquimalt Scraper** - Build Legistar InSite HTML scraper, run full pipeline for recent Esquimalt meetings
- [ ] **Phase 43: Subdomain Routing** - Hostname-based municipality resolution, DNS/wrangler config, unknown subdomain 404
- [ ] **Phase 44: Branding & Ship** - Dynamic municipality branding across all pages, end-to-end verification, go-live

## Phase Details

### Phase 41: Data Isolation
**Goal**: Every page, search, and AI answer returns data from only the current municipality
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.8)
**Requirements**: SCOPE-01, SCOPE-02, SCOPE-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visiting viewroyal.ai shows only View Royal meetings, motions, people, and matters -- no Esquimalt data appears
  2. Searching on viewroyal.ai returns only View Royal results across all content types (keyword and vector)
  3. Asking the RAG agent a question on viewroyal.ai produces answers citing only View Royal sources
  4. Service layer functions all accept and filter by municipality_id (no unscoped queries remain)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 41-01-PLAN.md -- SQL RPC migrations + direct-table service scoping + route loader updates
- [ ] 41-02-PLAN.md -- Search stack + people/profiling/analytics scoping
- [ ] 41-03-PLAN.md -- RAG agent scoping + municipality scoping tests

### Phase 42: Esquimalt Scraper
**Goal**: Recent Esquimalt council meeting data is ingested into the database through the full pipeline
**Depends on**: Phase 41
**Requirements**: SCRP-01, SCRP-02, SCRP-03, SCRP-04, SCRP-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Running the pipeline with `--municipality esquimalt` scrapes meetings from Esquimalt's Legistar Calendar.aspx
  2. Scraped meetings include agenda items, attachments, vote records, and linked PDFs
  3. Esquimalt body types (Council, COTW, APC, etc.) appear as distinct organizations in the database
  4. Granicus video URLs are extracted and stored for meetings that have video
  5. Full pipeline completes (scrape, ingest, embed) for at least 6 months of recent Esquimalt meetings
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 42-01: TBD
- [ ] 42-02: TBD

### Phase 43: Subdomain Routing
**Goal**: Requests to esquimalt.viewroyal.ai resolve to Esquimalt data and unknown subdomains are rejected
**Depends on**: Phase 41
**Requirements**: ROUT-01, ROUT-02, ROUT-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Visiting esquimalt.viewroyal.ai loads the web app with Esquimalt municipality context
  2. Visiting viewroyal.ai continues to load View Royal as before
  3. Visiting garbage.viewroyal.ai returns a 404 page
  4. The esquimalt subdomain DNS record resolves and the Worker receives the request
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 43-01: TBD

### Phase 44: Branding & Ship
**Goal**: Esquimalt users see Esquimalt branding everywhere and the platform is verified end-to-end before go-live
**Depends on**: Phase 42, Phase 43
**Requirements**: BRND-01, BRND-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Page titles, navbar, footer, and OG meta on esquimalt.viewroyal.ai display "Township of Esquimalt" (not "ViewRoyal.ai")
  2. The about page on esquimalt.viewroyal.ai describes Esquimalt's data sources and council structure
  3. Meetings, motions, people, and search on esquimalt.viewroyal.ai show only Esquimalt data with correct branding
  4. View Royal pages remain unchanged -- no regressions in branding or data
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 44-01: TBD
- [ ] 44-02: TBD

<details>
<summary>v1.8 RDOS Ingestion (Deferred)</summary>

**Milestone Goal:** Ingest RDOS Board of Directors meetings (2025+) through the full pipeline -- scrape from Escribemeetings, download YouTube video, diarize, AI refine, and embed -- proving multi-municipality ingestion works end-to-end.

- [ ] **Phase 32: Municipality Foundation + Escribemeetings Scraper** - RDOS database record and Escribemeetings API scraper for meeting discovery and document download
- [ ] **Phase 33: Agenda Parsing** - Structured HTML agenda parsing with PDF+AI fallback
- [ ] **Phase 34: YouTube Video Client** - YouTube channel listing, audio download, and orchestrator routing
- [ ] **Phase 35: Board Members** - Scrape RDOS board members and election data into people tables
- [ ] **Phase 36: End-to-End Integration** - Full 5-phase pipeline run for RDOS Board meetings
