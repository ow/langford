# ViewRoyal.ai — Civic Intelligence Platform

## What This Is

A civic transparency platform that scrapes council meeting documents and video from municipal websites, diarizes speakers, extracts structured data with AI, and serves it through a searchable web app with subscription-based email alerts and a public REST API with developer documentation. Citizens can browse meetings, motions, bylaws, people, and matters — search across all content types with hybrid keyword+vector search — ask natural language questions answered by a RAG agent with conversation memory — view AI-generated councillor stance summaries backed by evidence — compare councillors side by side — and subscribe to topics for personalized email digests. Developers can integrate via authenticated REST and OCD-standard APIs with interactive documentation at docs.viewroyal.ai.

## Core Value

Citizens can understand what their council decided, why, and who said what — without attending meetings or reading hundreds of pages of PDFs.

### Active

## Current Milestone: v1.8 Esquimalt Launch

**Goal:** Validate the Legistar scraper against Esquimalt, ingest recent meetings through the full pipeline, add hostname-based municipality routing, and deploy Esquimalt at esquimalt.viewroyal.ai with the full feature set.

**Target features:**
- Validate and fix Legistar scraper against real Esquimalt data
- Full pipeline run for recent Esquimalt meetings (scrape → ingest → embed)
- Hostname-based subdomain routing (subdomain → municipality context in Worker)
- Esquimalt live at esquimalt.viewroyal.ai with full feature parity
- Unknown subdomains return 404

### Out of Scope
- RDOS ingestion — deferred beyond v1.8
- Push notifications / native app — overkill for current user base size
- Social features (comments, reactions, forums) — undermines official record credibility
- Real-time live meeting notifications — architecture mismatch (batch pipeline)
- SMS notifications — cost/compliance overhead unjustified at current scale
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) — inappropriate for civic audience; magic links are lower friction

## Context

Shipped v1.7 with ~49,000 LOC (TypeScript + Python), 40+ database tables, developer docs portal at docs.viewroyal.ai.
Tech stack: React Router 7, Cloudflare Workers, Hono + chanfana (API), Supabase PostgreSQL + pgvector, Google Gemini (gemini-3-flash-preview + gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview for reranking), fastembed, fumadocs v16 + Next.js 16 (docs).
v1.0: 6 phases, 11 plans. v1.1: 6 phases, 20 plans. v1.2: 3 phases, 5 plans. v1.3: 4 phases, 14 plans. v1.4: 6 phases, 10 plans. v1.5: 4 phases, 7 plans. v1.6: 3 phases, 7 plans. v1.7: 4 phases, 9 plans.

**Known technical debt:**
- `bootstrap.sql` is out of date with 30+ applied migrations
- Phase 7.1 Gemini Batch API extraction paused — backfill waiting on quota
- `document_chunker.py` and several web modules lack dedicated test coverage
- Email delivery requires one-time external Resend/SMTP configuration
- `matters/detail.ts` dead query in Promise.all (wasted DB round-trip)
- `slugs.ts` utility created but unused (slugs resolved via DB columns)
- API search is keyword-only; hybrid vector+keyword descoped
- Rate Limit binding pricing needs verification before production launch
- Gemini cost projection: reranking + classification + profiling add new API consumers

## Constraints

- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers — no `process.env`, no Node.js APIs, env vars inlined at build time via Vite
- **AI**: Google Gemini (gemini-3-flash-preview) for refinement + RAG + stances; fastembed for pipeline embeddings
- **Diarization**: MLX on Apple Silicon — pipeline runs locally, not in CI/CD
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth with public signup (needs dashboard toggle to enable)
- **Cost**: Gemini API calls per meeting; Legistar fast path skips AI for structured sources
- **Email**: Resend via Supabase Edge Function; needs API key and domain DNS configuration

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Monorepo with pnpm workspaces | Web app + pipeline + proxy share repo but deploy independently | ✓ Good |
| Supabase for DB + auth + storage | Managed Postgres with pgvector, auth, storage, edge functions | ✓ Good |
| Cloudflare Workers for web app | SSR at edge, KV/R2 available, single deployment | ✓ Good |
| Municipality context via DB, not config files | Enables runtime discovery of towns, no redeploy to add one | ✓ Good |
| halfvec(384) over vector(768) | 95% storage reduction, Matryoshka truncation preserves quality | ✓ Good |
| Resend for transactional email | Free tier sufficient for initial scale, Edge Function compatible | ✓ Good |
| PyMuPDF font-analysis for doc chunking | Body_size * 1.2 threshold for headings, no ML dependency | ✓ Good |
| Hybrid search with RRF over Elasticsearch | pgvector + tsvector covers hybrid search natively | ✓ Good |
| Gemini for stance generation | Same provider as refinement, lazy singleton pattern | ✓ Good |
| Category normalization as IMMUTABLE SQL fn | Covers ~300/470 categories to 8 topics, no RPC needed | ✓ Good |
| @google/genai SDK over @google/generative-ai | New official SDK, model-per-call pattern, async iterables | ✓ Good |
| Pre-deploy test gating | pytest + vitest must pass before wrangler deploy | ✓ Good |
| Phase 7.1 pause (Batch API) | DOC requirements satisfied by Phase 7; batch backfill deferred | ✓ Good |
| Reuse audit.py for update detection | Existing find_meetings_needing_reingest() covers document changes | ✓ Good |
| MOSHI_TOKEN as feature toggle | Missing token silently disables notifications, no CLI flag needed | ✓ Good |
| fcntl.flock for pipeline lock | Auto-releases on crash/kill, no stale pidfile cleanup needed | ✓ Good |
| launchd over cron | Native macOS, better logging integration, StartCalendarInterval | ✓ Good |
| Hono alongside React Router in same Worker | URL-prefix split at fetch level (/api/v1/* and /api/ocd/* to Hono, rest to RR7) | ✓ Good |
| chanfana for OpenAPI generation | Auto-generates spec from Zod schemas, serves Swagger UI, minimal boilerplate | ✓ Good |
| SHA-256 over bcrypt for API keys | Keys are high-entropy random strings; SHA-256 is fast and sufficient | ✓ Good |
| CF Workers Rate Limit binding | Durable rate limiting across isolate evictions, per-key scoping | ✓ Good |
| Cursor-based pagination (v1 API) | Opaque base64 cursors, stable ordering, no offset-skip performance issues | ✓ Good |
| Page-based pagination (OCD API) | Matches OpenStates convention for civic tech compatibility | ✓ Good |
| UUID v5 via Web Crypto for OCD IDs | No npm dependency, deterministic IDs from entity PKs, Cloudflare-compatible | ✓ Good |
| Plain Hono handlers for OCD (not chanfana) | OCD has its own spec; OpenAPI generation unnecessary for those endpoints | ✓ Good |
| Serializer allowlist pattern | Never spread ...row; explicitly construct output objects to prevent field leakage | ✓ Good |
| Fire-and-forget trace insert | No await on rag_traces insert to avoid blocking SSE stream delivery | ✓ Good |
| Dual-write PostHog + Supabase traces | Same traceId in both for gradual migration path | ✓ Good |
| normalizeMotionResult canonical utility | Single RESULT_MAP covering all 11 DB values + typos, replaces 17 inline implementations | ✓ Good |
| Consolidated RAG tools (10 -> 4) | Promise.all sub-queries in each tool reduce agent confusion and round-trips | ✓ Good |
| Gemini Flash Lite for reranking | Fast and cheap model sufficient for relevance scoring; graceful degradation on failure | ✓ Good |
| SQL-first topic classification | bulk_classify_topics_by_category RPC handles majority; Gemini only for unmapped categories | ✓ Good |
| Vote counts from votes table | Not from motions.yes_votes/no_votes columns due to data quality issues | ✓ Good |
| Composite key vote scoring | minority*3 + closeness*2 + ally_breaks*1 balances detection pattern importance | ✓ Good |
| 6-tab profile page layout | Profile tab as default shows AI narrative first; General/Administration topics filtered | ✓ Good |
| Municipality meta for attendance | JSONB meta field with per-meeting sparse overrides; zero-migration deployment | ✓ Good |
| Compact email list format | Cards take too much vertical space; compact list scans better on mobile | ✓ Good |
| Fumadocs v16 + Next.js 16 static export | No server runtime needed; static `out/` served by Workers Static Assets | ✓ Good |
| Cloudflare Workers Static Assets (not Pages) | Pages deprecated; `[assets]` directive in wrangler.toml is the modern approach | ✓ Good |
| generateFiles() for OpenAPI MDX | No RSC server available in static export; prebuild generates MDX at build time | ✓ Good |
| Prebuild script with committed fallback spec | Live API fetch at build time, checked-in openapi.json for offline builds | ✓ Good |
| pnpm workspace with shamefully-hoist | wrangler/vite plugins need hoisted deps; workspace keeps apps independent | ✓ Good |
| fumadocs baseUrl: '/' for root-level serving | Docs served at docs.viewroyal.ai root, not /docs/ subpath | ✓ Good |
