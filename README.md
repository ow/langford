# ViewRoyal.ai

An open-source civic intelligence platform for the Town of View Royal, BC. Browse council meetings, watch video with synced transcripts, explore voting records, and ask AI-powered questions about local government decisions.

**Live at [viewroyal.ai](https://viewroyal.ai)**

## Features

- **Meeting Explorer** -- Watch council meeting video with a synced sidebar showing agenda items, motions, and speaker-attributed transcripts
- **Unified Search** -- Perplexity-style single search page with auto-intent detection: keyword queries show hybrid-ranked results across all content types; natural language questions trigger streaming AI answers with inline citations

- **Voting Records** -- See how each council member voted on every motion, with alignment analysis
- **AI Q&A** -- Multi-tool RAG agent with streaming answers, confidence indicators, conversation follow-ups (5-turn memory), and shareable cached answer URLs
- **Key Statement Extraction** -- AI-extracted typed statements (claims, proposals, objections, recommendations, financial impacts, public input) attributed to speakers
- **Council Profiles** -- Attendance stats, voting history, speaking time metrics (trend sparkline, topic breakdown, peer ranking), and AI-generated stance summaries per topic with confidence scoring and evidence quotes
- **Councillor Comparison** -- Side-by-side comparison of any two councillors: voting alignment percentage, per-topic stance agreement indicators, activity stats, and speaking time by topic
- **Bylaw & Matter Tracking** -- Follow issues as they move through council across multiple meetings
- **Election History** -- Past election results with candidate details

**Data flow:** CivicWeb (PDFs/HTML) + Vimeo (video/audio) --> Python pipeline (5 phases) --> Supabase --> React Router web app

**Municipality context layer:** The root loader fetches the municipality row (currently hardcoded to slug `"view-royal"`), providing `name`, `short_name`, `website_url`, `rss_url`, `contact_email`, and `map_center` to all routes. Meta tags, service queries, AI prompts, and component copy are all driven by this data rather than hardcoded strings.

## Apps

- **[Web App](apps/web/)** -- React Router 7 frontend deployed to Cloudflare Workers. [README](apps/web/README.md)
- **[Data Pipeline](apps/pipeline/)** -- Python ETL pipeline for scraping, transcription, and AI-powered ingestion. [README](apps/pipeline/README.md)

| `votes` | Individual council member votes on each motion |
| `transcript_segments` | Speaker-attributed transcript with timestamps and full-text search |
| `key_statements` | AI-extracted typed statements (claim/proposal/objection/recommendation/financial/public_input) |
| `meeting_speaker_aliases` | Maps diarization labels (Speaker_01) to real people |
| `matters` | Longitudinal topics tracked across meetings |
| `bylaws` + `bylaw_chunks` | Bylaw text split into searchable chunks |
| `documents` | Meeting PDFs (agendas, minutes, staff reports) |
| `people` | Council members, staff, public delegates |
| `organizations` + `memberships` | Governance structure and roles |
| `elections` + `candidacies` | Election history |
| `attendance` + `meeting_events` | Meeting participation tracking |
| `municipalities` | Municipality config: name, slug, website URL, RSS feed, map center, contact email |
| `topics` | Controlled taxonomy for agenda item classification |
| `councillor_stances` | AI-generated stance summaries per councillor per topic with position scores, confidence, and evidence |

**Search infrastructure:**
- `halfvec(384)` HNSW indexes on agenda_items, motions, matters, bylaws, bylaw_chunks, key_statements, meetings, documents
- `tsvector` GIN indexes for full-text search on transcript_segments, motions, agenda_items, matters, key_statements
- 3 `hybrid_search_*` RPC functions using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (vector + FTS)
- 7 `match_*` RPC functions for vector similarity search
- `search_results_cache` table for shareable AI answer URLs (30-day TTL)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (web app)
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (pipeline)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Database
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-service-role-key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:your-password@db.your-project.supabase.co:5432/postgres
SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# Web app (also needs these in apps/web/.env or root .env)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-anon-key
ADMIN_EMAILS=you@example.com

EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai
EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS=384
VIMEO_TOKEN=your-vimeo-api-token
```

### Database Setup

Apply the schema in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of sql/bootstrap.sql
```

### Web App

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # http://localhost:5173
pnpm deploy     # build + deploy to Cloudflare Workers
```

### Data Pipeline

See [Pipeline README](apps/pipeline/README.md) for full documentation.

Quick start:

```bash
cd apps/pipeline
uv run python main.py --download-audio
```

Internal queue/ops console:

```bash
pnpm dev:web            # http://localhost:5173
pnpm dev:worker         # processes queued /admin/pipeline jobs
pnpm dev:worker:once    # process at most one queued job
```

Open `/admin/pipeline` after signing in to discover source meetings, queue
document sync/ingest/extraction/embedding jobs, and inspect worker event logs.

## RAG Q&A System

The unified search page (`/search`) combines keyword search and AI Q&A in a single interface:

**Keyword Mode** -- Hybrid search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion across motions, key statements, document sections, and transcript segments. Results ranked by combined vector similarity + full-text relevance.

**AI Answer Mode** -- Streaming RAG agent with 9 tools:
- `search_motions` -- Hybrid search on motions (vector + FTS)
- `search_agenda_items` -- Full-text search on agenda items
- `search_key_statements` -- Hybrid search on extracted statements
- `search_document_sections` -- Hybrid search on PDF document sections
- `search_matters` -- Vector search on longitudinal topics
- `search_transcript_segments` -- Full-text search on transcripts
- `get_statements_by_person` -- Find what a specific person said
- `get_voting_history` -- Look up voting records
- `get_current_date` -- Date context

**Conversation Continuity** -- Follow-up questions carry context from previous answers (capped at 5 turns). Topic changes auto-clear context. Gemini generates suggested follow-up chips after each answer.

**Shareable URLs** -- Completed AI answers are cached with short IDs (`/search?id=abc123`) for sharing without re-generation.

Embeddings are generated via OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` at 384 dimensions (Matryoshka truncation), stored as `halfvec(384)` for 4x storage savings over full float32 vector(768).

## Adapting for Another Municipality

1. Add your municipality to the `municipalities` table in Supabase
2. Create a scraper class extending `BaseScraper` (or use an existing one if your source matches CivicWeb/Legistar/static HTML)
3. Register the scraper in `pipeline/scrapers/__init__.py`
4. Apply `sql/bootstrap.sql` to a fresh Supabase project
5. Run the pipeline: `uv run python main.py --municipality your-slug --download-audio`
6. Deploy the web app with your Supabase credentials
